### Python Assignment

What to do:

2. Fill in the required code to complete the `Problem_Statement` Jupyter Notebook.
3. Push the notebook to the `main` branch of your repository.
4. After the deadline, make your repository public (you will be given a reminder)

Note : If you are unfamiliar with Python and/or Jupyter notebooks, you may find [these](https://github.com/krittikaiitb/tutorials) tutorials by us useful. You will also of course find resources on everything needed for this online as well, so keep googling if you're stuck at any point!

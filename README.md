### Python Assignment

IMPORTANT : For some reason scipy did not work on my laptop, so I could not edit and run the Jupyter Notebook the normal way. I instead coded everything on Google Colab and edited the GitHub notebook using that too. The main part of the code remains the same, except that for opening the file on Colab one needs to mount it from Google Drive. 

My current GitHub code opens the files the normal way, hence on Google Colab I could not test-run it. I request the evaluators to please run the following anyone-can-access Colab notebook - https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Nmdil4giYhc8A3jxFa8x3_po9pKNHB9p?usp=sharing - in case the GitHub code doesn't work due to file-opening problems. Thank you.
